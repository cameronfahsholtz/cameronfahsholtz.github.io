            This shows three red LEDs blinking from top to bottom one after another
            alternating every 1/10th of a second.

            This picture shows the circuit.

            This is the schematic for the circuit. The resistance was calculated in the following way.
            v = (Power source) - (Voltage Drop for LED)
            v = 5V -1.8V = 3.2V
            I = 30 mA (Max current through red LED)
            R = V/I = 3.2V/O.03A = 106.7 Ohms
            Because of these calculations, I know that I must use a resister that is larger
            than 106.7 Ohms. I decided to use a 220 Ohms resisters because of this.

            This is the arduino code that I used to make the LEDs flash in the particular pattern.
            The code is commented on the code snippit.
