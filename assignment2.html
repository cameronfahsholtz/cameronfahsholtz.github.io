            This GIF shows a button that
            controls both a red and yellow LED and a tri-color LED that fades
            from red to green. When the button is being pressed, all LEDs turn on.

            This is the schematic for the circuit. The resistance for the tri-color LED
            was calculated in the following way.
            v = (Power source) - (Voltage Drop for LED)
            v = 5V -1.8V = 3.2V
            I = 30 mA (Max current through red LED)
            R = V/I = 3.2V/O.03A = 106.7 Ohms
            Because of these calculations, I know that I must use a resister that is larger
            than 106.7 Ohms. I decided to use a 220 Ohms resisters because of this.
            The resistance for the two LEDs in series was calculated using the same
            logic as above. I knew that a 220 Ohms resistor would also be larger than
            what two LEDs in series would need.
            I used a 220 Ohms resister for the pushbutton as well.

            This is the arduino code that I used to make the LEDs flash in the particular pattern.
            The code is commented on the code snippit.
