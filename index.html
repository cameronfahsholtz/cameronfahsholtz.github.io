            My name is Cameron! I'm an HCDE major and excited to learn the following things in this class:
            how to make physical prototypes that can be controlled with code.

      Assignment 3 was a circuit that responds to the intensity of light and based
      on the amount of light, changes the color or a tri-color LED.
